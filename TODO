TODO:
    - compare ltl results with just the realizable lucas tests
    - run lucas with mealy semantics (which means passing 1 to the tool) and comparing directly with ltl

    - if running with mealy, ltlfilt will be equivalent to lucas, normal ltl is not guarnteed (suspected the same because of the design of the games, do not know).


run lucas with moore
    if realizable -> ltlfilt should also realizable, ltl suspected realizable
    if not realizable -> dont know

run lucas with mealy
    realizable <-> ltlfilt should also realizable, ltl suspected realizable
